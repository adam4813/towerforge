- ✅ Visual feedback and animations

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Follows existing TowerForge UI patterns
- Uses C++20 features appropriately
- Integrates with game mode system
- Supports both keyboard and mouse input
- Maintains separation of concerns

### Integration Points
1. **Title Screen Flow**: Main Menu → Settings → General Settings → Audio Settings → Back → Back → Main Menu
2. **Pause Menu Flow**: Game → Pause (ESC) → Settings → General Settings → Audio Settings → Back → Back → Pause → Resume → Game

### Code Quality
- Clean, well-documented code
- Consistent naming conventions
- Minimal changes to existing code
- No breaking changes
- Follows project coding standards

## Testing

### Build Testing
- ✅ Project builds successfully without errors or warnings
- ✅ All targets compile correctly
- ✅ No new dependencies required

### Manual Testing Performed
- ✅ Settings accessible from title screen
- ✅ Settings accessible from pause menu
- ✅ Audio settings navigation works correctly
- ✅ Back buttons function properly
- ✅ ESC key works for navigation
- ✅ Volume sliders respond to keyboard input
- ✅ Volume sliders respond to mouse input
- ✅ Visual feedback is consistent and smooth
- ✅ No crashes or memory leaks observed

## Screenshots

### General Settings Menu

- **Gameplay Settings** - Difficulty, auto-save frequency, tutorials

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **All acceptance criteria met:**
- Menu is accessible from both title and pause menu
- Audio settings button works and returns to general menu
- Matches ASCII mockup design
- Settings changes apply immediately
- Professional appearance
- Keyboard and mouse navigation
- Consistent with game UI style

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been added in `docs/GENERAL_SETTINGS_MENU_IMPLEMENTATION.md` covering:
- Architecture and design decisions
- User interaction patterns
- Integration with game modes
- Future enhancement plans
- Implementation notes

## Summary

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the game's settings system while maintaining code quality and consistency with the existing codebase. The modular design allows for easy addition of new settings categories in the future.
