# TowerForge

A modern open-source SimTower-inspired skyscraper simulation game built with C++20.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++20
- **ECS**: [flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs)
- **Rendering**: [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
- **Build System**: CMake 3.20+
- **Package Manager**: vcpkg

## Building

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.20 or higher
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- vcpkg (clone next to this repo or set VCPKG_ROOT)

**Linux Additional Requirements:**
- X11 development libraries: `libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`
  ```bash
  # On Ubuntu/Debian:
  sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
  ```

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adam4813/towerforge.git
cd towerforge

# Clone vcpkg if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh  # or bootstrap-vcpkg.bat on Windows

# Build the project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build .

# Run the application
./bin/towerforge
```

**Note:** The first build will take longer as vcpkg downloads and builds dependencies (Raylib, GLFW3, flecs, etc.).

### Cross-Platform Support

- **Windows**: Visual Studio 2019+ or MinGW-w64
- **Linux**: GCC 10+ or Clang 10+
- **macOS**: Xcode 12+ or Clang 10+

## Architecture

TowerForge is designed with a modular architecture to support future multiplayer features:

- **Core**: Headless simulation library (ECS-based)
  - Built on [flecs ECS](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs) for high-performance entity management
  - Modular component-based architecture for easy extension
  - Example components: Actor (people), BuildingComponent (facilities)
  - Example systems: Movement, Actor logging, Building occupancy monitoring
- **Renderer**: 2D vector graphics using Raylib
  - Modular rendering system designed for easy ECS integration
  - Supports GUI, actors, building visuals, and more
  - Hardware-accelerated OpenGL rendering
- **Simulation**: Tower management, tenants, elevators, people AI

### Rendering System

The rendering system is built on [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), a simple and easy-to-use library for 2D graphics:

- **Modular Design**: The `Renderer` class in `include/rendering/renderer.h` provides a clean interface
- **ECS Ready**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with the flecs ECS for entity rendering
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new rendering features (sprites, text, particles, etc.)

Current demo renders:
- A blue rectangle (representing a building floor)
- A red circle (representing a person or elevator)

### ECS Structure

The Entity Component System (ECS) is the foundation of TowerForge's simulation. It provides:

**Components** (`include/core/components.hpp`):
- `Position`: 2D position in space
- `Velocity`: Movement velocity
- `Actor`: Represents people in the building (name, destination floor, speed)
- `BuildingComponent`: Represents building facilities (offices, restaurants, shops, etc.)
- `TimeManager`: Global singleton for simulation time management (hours, days, weeks, speed control)
- `DailySchedule`: Component for entities with time-based routines (work hours, breaks, etc.)
- `GridPosition`: Grid-based position (floor, column, width)

**Tower Grid System** (`include/core/tower_grid.hpp`):
- 2D grid system for spatial management of the tower
- Supports adding/removing floors and columns dynamically
- Facility placement and removal with collision detection
- Spatial query functions for grid operations
- Integrated with ECS for seamless tower management

**Systems** (`src/core/ecs_world.cpp`):
- **Time Simulation System**: Advances simulation time based on configurable speed multiplier
- **Schedule Execution System**: Triggers scheduled actions for entities at specific times
- **Movement System**: Updates entity positions based on velocity
- **Actor Logging System**: Monitors and logs actor activity
- **Building Occupancy Monitor**: Tracks occupancy of building components

**ECS World** (`include/core/ecs_world.hpp`):
- Wrapper around flecs world for clean API
- Manages component and system registration
- Provides entity creation and simulation update methods
- Integrated with FacilityManager for high-level facility operations

### Facility System

The Facility System provides a comprehensive framework for creating and managing building facilities in the tower. See [docs/FACILITIES.md](docs/FACILITIES.md) for detailed documentation.

**Core Facility Types**:
- **Office**: Commercial office space (generates rent, holds ~20 workers)
- **Residential**: Condominium units (housing for residents, holds ~4 people per unit)
- **RetailShop**: Retail shops (provides shopping, holds ~15 customers)
- **Lobby**: Main entrance (required on ground floor, holds ~50 people)

**Legacy Types** (for compatibility):
- Restaurant, Hotel, Elevator

**Facility Manager** (`include/core/facility_manager.hpp`):
- High-level API for creating and removing facilities
- Automatic default attributes (width, capacity) for each facility type
- Integration with tower grid for placement validation
- Color management for rendering

**Example Usage**:
```cpp
auto& facility_mgr = ecs_world.GetFacilityManager();

// Create a lobby on ground floor
auto lobby = facility_mgr.CreateFacility(
    BuildingComponent::Type::Lobby, 
    0,     // floor
    0,     // column
    0,     // width (0 = use default)
    "MainLobby"
);

// Create an office on floor 1
auto office = facility_mgr.CreateFacility(
    BuildingComponent::Type::Office,
    1, 2   // floor 1, column 2
);

// Remove a facility
facility_mgr.RemoveFacility(office);
// or by position
facility_mgr.RemoveFacilityAt(1, 2);
```

### Using the ECS

```cpp
#include "core/ecs_world.hpp"
#include "core/components.hpp"

// Create and initialize ECS world
TowerForge::Core::ECSWorld world;
world.Initialize();

// Set up global time manager (60x speed)
world.GetWorld().set<TimeManager>({60.0f});

// Create an actor entity with a daily schedule
auto actor = world.CreateEntity("John");
actor.set<Position>({10.0f, 0.0f});
actor.set<Velocity>({0.5f, 0.0f});
actor.set<Actor>({"John", 5, 1.0f});

// Add daily schedule
DailySchedule schedule;
schedule.AddWeekdayAction(ScheduledAction::Type::ArriveWork, 9.0f);   // 9 AM
schedule.AddWeekdayAction(ScheduledAction::Type::LunchBreak, 12.0f);  // 12 PM
schedule.AddWeekdayAction(ScheduledAction::Type::LeaveWork, 17.0f);   // 5 PM
actor.set<DailySchedule>(schedule);

// Create a building component
auto office = world.CreateEntity("Office");
office.set<BuildingComponent>({
    BuildingComponent::Type::Office,
    5,   // floor
    8,   // width
    20   // capacity
});

// Run simulation
float delta_time = 1.0f / 60.0f;
world.Update(delta_time);
```

### Time Simulation System

The time simulation system enables scheduled routines and day/night cycles:

**Features:**
- Configurable simulation speed (pause, normal, fast-forward)
- In-game time tracking (hours, days of week, weeks)
- Daily/weekly schedules for entities
- Automatic triggering of scheduled actions
- Day/night cycle detection
- Business hours tracking

**Time Manager:**
```cpp
// Create time manager with custom speed (e.g., 120 in-game hours per real second)
world.GetWorld().set<TimeManager>({120.0f});

// Access time manager
const auto& time_mgr = world.GetWorld().get<TimeManager>();
std::string current_time = time_mgr.GetTimeString();  // "14:30"
bool is_work_hours = time_mgr.IsBusinessHours();      // 9 AM - 5 PM
bool is_weekend = time_mgr.IsWeekend();                // Saturday/Sunday
```

**Daily Schedules:**
```cpp
DailySchedule schedule;

// Weekday schedule
schedule.AddWeekdayAction(ScheduledAction::Type::ArriveWork, 9.0f);
schedule.AddWeekdayAction(ScheduledAction::Type::LunchBreak, 12.0f);
schedule.AddWeekdayAction(ScheduledAction::Type::LeaveWork, 17.0f);

// Weekend schedule  
schedule.AddWeekendAction(ScheduledAction::Type::Idle, 10.0f);

// Attach to entity
entity.set<DailySchedule>(schedule);
### Using the Tower Grid

```cpp
#include "core/ecs_world.hpp"
#include "core/tower_grid.hpp"

// Create and initialize ECS world
TowerForge::Core::ECSWorld world;
world.Initialize();

// Access the tower grid
auto& grid = world.GetTowerGrid();

// Add floors and columns
grid.AddFloors(5);   // Add 5 more floors
grid.AddColumns(10); // Add 10 more columns

// Place a facility on the grid
int facility_id = 1;
bool placed = grid.PlaceFacility(
    3,           // floor
    5,           // column
    8,           // width (in grid cells)
    facility_id  // entity ID
);

// Query the grid
bool occupied = grid.IsOccupied(3, 5);
int id = grid.GetFacilityAt(3, 5);
bool available = grid.IsSpaceAvailable(2, 10, 5);

// Remove a facility
grid.RemoveFacility(facility_id);
```

cd build
./bin/towerforge
```

The demo creates example actors and building components, then runs a 30-second simulation showing:
- Time advancing through multiple days and weeks
- Scheduled actions triggered at specific times
- Different behavior for weekdays vs. weekends
- Actors moving with velocity
- Periodic logging of actor positions and building occupancy
- UI display of current time, day, week, and day/night cycle
