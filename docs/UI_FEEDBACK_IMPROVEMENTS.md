# UI Feedback and Confirmation Dialogs Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of enhanced user feedback, confirmation dialogs, and progress indicators added to TowerForge to improve user experience and prevent accidental destructive actions.

## Features Added

### 1. Button Press Visual Feedback

**Location**: `include/ui/ui_element.h`, `src/ui/ui_element.cpp`

The `Button` class now provides immediate visual feedback when pressed:

- **Press Animation**: Buttons shrink slightly (5%) and brighten when clicked
- **Smooth Animation**: Press effect fades out over ~0.2 seconds for professional feel
- **Hover State**: Buttons brighten when hovered (already existed, now enhanced)
- **Disabled State**: Buttons appear faded and don't respond to clicks

**Technical Details**:
- Added `is_pressed_` boolean and `press_animation_` float (0.0-1.0) to Button class
- New `Update(float delta_time)` method handles animation decay
- `Render()` applies scale transform and color brightening based on animation state
- Animation uses simple linear decay for smooth visual feedback

### 2. Reusable ConfirmationDialog Component

**Location**: `include/ui/ui_element.h`, `src/ui/ui_element.cpp`

A new modal dialog component for confirming destructive or expensive actions:

- **Modal Behavior**: Blocks interaction with game world while visible
- **Customizable**: Title, message, and button text can be customized
- **Callbacks**: Separate callbacks for confirm and cancel actions
- **Centered Display**: Always renders centered on screen with semi-transparent overlay
- **Word Wrapping**: Automatically wraps long messages to fit dialog width

**Usage Example**:
```cpp
auto dialog = std::make_unique<ConfirmationDialog>(
    "Confirm Demolish",
    "Are you sure you want to demolish this facility?",
    "Demolish",
    "Cancel"
);

dialog->SetConfirmCallback([this]() {
    // Perform demolish action
});

dialog->Show();
```

### 3. Demolish Confirmation Dialog

**Location**: `include/ui/placement_system.h`, `src/ui/placement_system.cpp`

Prevents accidental facility demolition:

- **Triggered**: When user clicks a facility in demolish mode
- **Information**: Shows facility type and refund amount (50%)
- **Confirmation**: User must click "Demolish" to proceed
- **Cancellation**: Click "Cancel" or press ESC to abort
- **Funds Handling**: Funds are only deducted after confirmation

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `demolish_confirmation_` dialog to PlacementSystem
- Stores pending demolish in `pending_demolish_floor_/column_/funds_`
- Confirmation callback performs actual demolish
- `GetPendingFundsChange()` retrieves result for game loop
- Mouse events routed through `ProcessMouseEvent()` for dialog interaction

### 4. Research Unlock Confirmation Dialog

**Location**: `include/ui/research_tree_menu.h`, `src/ui/research_tree_menu.cpp`

Confirms expensive research unlocks:

- **Triggered**: When user clicks an upgradable research node
- **Information**: Shows node name and tower points cost
- **Notification**: Success notification via NotificationCenter on unlock
- **Dynamic Message**: Dialog message updates with specific node details

**Integration**:
- Connected to NotificationCenter for unlock notifications
- Dialog message includes specific node name and cost
- Unlock only proceeds after user confirms
- Failed unlocks (insufficient points) show error notifications

### 5. Enhanced Placement Failure Notifications

**Location**: `src/core/game.cpp`, `src/ui/placement_system.cpp`

Provides specific feedback when facility placement fails:

- **Insufficient Funds**: Shows exact amount needed and current balance
- **Space Not Available**: Clear message about blocked placement
- **Visual Feedback**: Red preview overlay shows invalid placement
- **Error Type**: Uses appropriate notification type (Error, Warning)

**Example Notifications**:
- "Insufficient funds! Need $8000 (have $5000)"
- "Cannot place facility here - space not available"

### 6. Game Loop Integration

**Location**: `src/core/game.cpp`

Proper event routing and state management:

- **Mouse Event Routing**: Events routed to dialogs before game world
- **Demolish Funds**: Pending demolish funds retrieved each frame
- **Research Events**: Research menu events handled before node clicks
- **Notification Center**: Connected to research menu for unlock notifications

## User Experience Flow

### Demolishing a Facility

1. User enters demolish mode (press D or click Demolish button)
2. User clicks on a facility
3. Confirmation dialog appears showing facility type and refund
4. User clicks "Demolish" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort
5. If confirmed:
   - Facility is removed
   - Funds are refunded (50% of cost)
   - Success notification appears
   - Audio feedback plays

### Unlocking Research

1. User opens research tree (press R)
2. User hovers over an upgradable node (gold border)
3. Details panel shows requirements and effects
4. User clicks the node
5. Confirmation dialog appears with node name and cost
6. User clicks "Unlock" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort
7. If confirmed:
   - Node is unlocked
   - Tower points are deducted
   - Success notification appears in notification center
   - Node color changes to green (unlocked)

### Placing a Facility (with failures)

1. User selects facility from build menu
2. User hovers over grid - preview shows in green (valid) or red (invalid)
3. User clicks to place
4. If placement fails:
   - Specific error notification appears
   - "Insufficient funds! Need $X (have $Y)" or
   - "Cannot place facility here - space not available"
5. If placement succeeds:
   - Facility is placed (enters construction)
   - Progress bar shows construction percentage
   - Success notification with cost appears
   - Construction completes after build time

## Button Animation Behavior

All buttons throughout the UI now have press feedback:

- **Normal**: Default colors
- **Hover**: Brightened by 20%
- **Pressed**: Brightened by 30%, scaled to 95%, offset down 2px
- **Animation**: Smooth fade over 0.2 seconds
- **Disabled**: 50% opacity, no hover/press effects

## Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
UIElement (base class)
├── Panel (container with background)
│   └── ConfirmationDialog (modal dialog)
│       ├── Button (confirm)
│       └── Button (cancel)
└── Button (interactive element)
```

### Event Flow

```
Mouse Click
    ↓
Game::HandleInGameInput()
    ↓
Create MouseEvent
    ↓
PlacementSystem::ProcessMouseEvent()
    ↓
ConfirmationDialog::ProcessMouseEvent()
    ↓
Button::OnClick()
    ↓
Callback executed
    ↓
Pending state updated
    ↓
Game::Update() retrieves pending changes
    ↓
Funds updated, notifications shown
```

### State Management

**PlacementSystem Demolish State**:
- `demolish_confirmation_` - Dialog instance
- `pending_demolish_floor_/column_` - Location to demolish
- `pending_demolish_funds_` - Current funds at demolish request
- `pending_funds_change_` - Refund amount after confirmation

**ResearchTreeMenu Unlock State**:
- `unlock_confirmation_` - Dialog instance
- `pending_unlock_node_id_` - Node ID to unlock
- `pending_unlock_tree_` - Reference to research tree
- `notification_center_` - For success notifications

## Files Modified

### Headers
- `include/ui/ui_element.h` - Button animation, ConfirmationDialog
- `include/ui/placement_system.h` - Demolish confirmation
- `include/ui/research_tree_menu.h` - Unlock confirmation, notifications

### Implementation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Button Feedback**
   - Click all menu buttons and verify visual press animation
   - Check hover states still work correctly
   - Verify disabled buttons don't respond to clicks

2. **Demolish Confirmation**
   - Enter demolish mode
   - Click a facility
   - Verify dialog appears with correct info
   - Test "Demolish" button - verify facility removed and funds refunded
   - Test "Cancel" button - verify no changes
   - Test clicking outside dialog - should not close (modal)

3. **Research Confirmation**
   - Open research tree
   - Click upgradable node
   - Verify dialog shows node name and cost
   - Test "Unlock" with sufficient points
   - Test "Unlock" with insufficient points (should fail gracefully)
   - Verify notification appears on success

4. **Placement Failures**
   - Select expensive facility
   - Try to place with insufficient funds
   - Verify specific error message
   - Try to place on occupied space
   - Verify space-not-available message

5. **Construction Progress**
   - Place a facility
   - Watch construction progress bar
   - Verify percentage updates smoothly
   - Verify facility becomes usable after completion

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for confirmations
2. **Animation**: Smooth dialog slide-in/out animations
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: ESC to cancel, Enter to confirm dialogs
4. **Multiple Confirmations**: Stack multiple dialogs if needed
5. **Undo Demolish**: Allow undo of demolish actions
6. **Batch Operations**: Confirm multiple demolishes at once
7. **Tooltips on Dialogs**: Show additional info on hover
8. **Progress Indicators**: Show research progress over time

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance user experience by:

- **Preventing Mistakes**: Confirmation dialogs stop accidental destructive actions
- **Clear Feedback**: Users always know why actions failed
- **Visual Polish**: Button animations make UI feel responsive
- **Progress Visibility**: Users see construction and unlock progress
- **Better Communication**: Specific error messages guide users

All changes follow modern C++ best practices and the existing TowerForge architecture.
