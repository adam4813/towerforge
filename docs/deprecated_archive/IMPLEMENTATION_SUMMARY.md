## Overview
This document summarizes major feature implementations in TowerForge, including the Facility System and the General Settings & Audio Menu. It details technical approaches, design decisions, and acceptance criteria for each system.

## Facility System Implementation

### Core Components (`include/core/components.hpp`)
- **BuildingComponent Type enum** includes:
  - Office
  - Residential (for condominiums)
  - RetailShop (renamed from Shop)
  - Lobby
  - Restaurant (legacy)
  - Hotel (legacy)
  - Elevator (legacy)
- Comprehensive documentation for each facility type
- Maintains structure: type, floor, width, capacity, current_occupancy

### FacilityManager (`include/core/facility_manager.hpp`, `src/core/facility_manager.cpp`)
A high-level API for facility management:
- `CreateFacility()`, `RemoveFacility()`, `RemoveFacilityAt()`
- `GetDefaultWidth()`, `GetDefaultCapacity()`, `GetTypeName()`, `GetFacilityColor()`, `GetFacilityType()`
- Centralized default attributes for each facility type

| Facility    | Width | Capacity | Purpose              |
|-------------|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Office      | 8     | 20       | Commercial workspace |
| Residential | 6     | 4        | Family housing       |
| RetailShop  | 4     | 15       | Retail shopping      |
| Lobby       | 10    | 50       | Main entrance        |
| Restaurant  | 6     | 30       | Food service         |
| Hotel       | 10    | 40       | Temporary lodging    |
| Elevator    | 2     | 8        | Vertical transport   |

### ECS Integration (`include/core/ecs_world.hpp`, `src/core/ecs_world.cpp`)
- FacilityManager integrated into ECSWorld
- `GetFacilityManager()` accessor
- Building occupancy monitor system uses FacilityManager for type names

### Documentation (`docs/FACILITIES.md`)
- Detailed descriptions, gameplay roles, placement rules, technical details, code examples, color scheme, and future plans

### Visual Rendering Updates
- Unique color for each facility type:
  - Office: SKYBLUE
  - Residential: PURPLE
  - RetailShop: GREEN
  - Lobby: GOLD
  - Restaurant: RED
  - Hotel: DARKBLUE
  - Elevator: GRAY
- Rendering code updated for consistency

### Example Applications
- `main.cpp`: Uses FacilityManager for facility creation
- `screenshot_app.cpp`: Demonstrates all core facility types

### Acceptance Criteria
- Facilities can be placed/removed via grid system
- Each type is visually distinct
- Data structures and ECS components are extensible
- Documentation covers usage and gameplay roles

### Technical Highlights
- Clean separation of concerns (core, rendering, grid)
- ECS-friendly design
- Minimal changes to existing code
- Future-ready and extensible

### Usage Examples
```cpp
// Create a Facility
auto& facility_mgr = ecs_world.GetFacilityManager();
auto office = facility_mgr.CreateFacility(
    BuildingComponent::Type::Office,
    floor, column, width, "OfficeName"
);

// Remove a Facility
facility_mgr.RemoveFacility(office);
// or
facility_mgr.RemoveFacilityAt(floor, column);

// Query Facilities
ecs_world.GetWorld().each([](BuildingComponent& bc) {
    if (bc.type == BuildingComponent::Type::Office) {
        // Do something with offices
    }
});
```

## General Settings & Audio Menu Implementation

### Features Implemented
- General Settings Menu accessible from title and pause menus
- Six menu options: Audio (fully functional), Controls, Display, Accessibility, Gameplay, Back
- Audio Settings: Master, Music, SFX volume sliders (0-100%), real-time feedback
- Keyboard and mouse navigation, visual feedback, gold highlighting
- Clean, professional UI matching game style

### Technical Details
- Follows TowerForge UI patterns, C++20 features
- Integrates with game mode system
- Supports keyboard/mouse input
- Minimal changes to existing code, no breaking changes

#### Integration Points
- Title Screen → Settings → General Settings → Audio Settings → Back
- Pause Menu → Settings → General Settings → Audio Settings → Back

### Testing
- Project builds without errors/warnings
- Settings accessible from both title and pause menus
- Audio settings navigation and sliders work (keyboard/mouse)
- Visual feedback is consistent
- No crashes or memory leaks

### Future Enhancements
- Controls Settings: Keybinding, mouse sensitivity
- Display Settings: Resolution, fullscreen, graphics
- Accessibility: Color blind modes, text size
- Gameplay: Difficulty, auto-save, tutorials

---

## Conclusion
This document summarizes the implementation of the Facility System and the General Settings & Audio Menu in TowerForge. Both systems are modular, extensible, and follow modern C++20 and ECS best practices. The codebase is well-documented, visually consistent, and ready for future enhancements in both simulation and user interface features.
