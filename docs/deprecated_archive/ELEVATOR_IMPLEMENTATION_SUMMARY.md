# Elevator System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete elevator system for TowerForge with realistic elevator behavior, passenger management, and seamless integration with the existing Person Movement System.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Components (`include/core/components.hpp`)

#### ElevatorShaft
Represents a vertical shaft containing elevator cars.

**Fields:**
- `column`: Grid column location
- `bottom_floor`: Lowest floor served
- `top_floor`: Highest floor served
- `car_count`: Number of cars in shaft

**Methods:**
- `GetFloorRange()`: Total floors served
- `ServesFloor(int floor)`: Check if floor is within range

#### ElevatorCar
Individual elevator car with complete state machine.

**Fields:**
- `shaft_entity_id`: Reference to parent shaft
- `current_floor`: Current position (float for smooth movement)
- `target_floor`: Next destination
- `state`: Current state (6-state machine)
- `max_capacity`: Maximum passengers (default: 8)
- `current_occupancy`: Current passenger count
- `stop_queue`: Sorted list of requested stops
- `passenger_destinations`: Destination floors of current passengers
- `door_open_duration`: 2.0 seconds
- `door_transition_duration`: 1.0 second
- `floors_per_second`: 2.0 floors/second

**State Machine:**
```
Idle → MovingUp/MovingDown → DoorsOpening → DoorsOpen → DoorsClosing → Idle
```

**Methods:**
- `GetStateString()`: State name for debugging
- `IsAtFloor()`: Check if at floor position
- `GetCurrentFloorInt()`: Current floor as integer
- `HasCapacity()`: Check capacity available
- `AddStop(int floor)`: Add floor to queue (sorted)
- `GetNextStop()`: Get next stop considering direction
- `RemoveCurrentStop()`: Remove current floor from queue

#### PersonElevatorRequest
Links Person entities to elevators for boarding.

**Fields:**
- `shaft_entity_id`: Which shaft person is using
- `car_entity_id`: Which car person is in (-1 if waiting)
- `call_floor`: Where person called from
- `destination_floor`: Where person wants to go
- `wait_time`: Total waiting time
- `is_boarding`: Currently boarding flag

**Lifecycle:**
1. Created when person needs elevator
2. Persists during waiting and riding
3. Removed when person exits at destination

### 2. ECS Systems (`src/core/ecs_world.cpp`)

#### Elevator Car Movement System
**Frequency:** Every frame (OnUpdate)

**Behavior:**
- **Idle**: Checks queue, transitions to movement if stops exist
- **MovingUp/MovingDown**: Smooth interpolation between floors at 2 floors/second
- **DoorsOpening**: 1-second transition, removes stop from queue
- **DoorsOpen**: 2-second duration for boarding/exiting
- **DoorsClosing**: 1-second transition back to Idle

#### Elevator Call System
**Frequency:** Every frame (OnUpdate)

**Behavior:**
- Updates wait time for all waiting people
- Assigns unassigned people to available cars
- Adds call floor and destination to car's stop queue
- Simple first-available-car algorithm (can be enhanced)

#### Person Elevator Boarding System
**Frequency:** Every frame (OnUpdate)

**Behavior:**
- **Boarding**: Checks person waiting, car arrived at call floor, doors open, capacity available
  - Transitions person to InElevator
  - Increments car occupancy
  - Adds destination to passenger list
- **Exiting**: Checks person in elevator, car at destination, doors open
  - Updates person floor
  - Decrements car occupancy
  - Removes PersonElevatorRequest
  - Transitions to Walking or AtDestination

#### Elevator Logging System
**Frequency:** Every 10 seconds (interval)

**Behavior:**
- Logs car state, floor, occupancy
- Shows stop queue for debugging

### 3. Integration with Person Movement System

#### Enhanced Person Waiting System
- Creates PersonElevatorRequest when person needs to change floors
- Searches for suitable elevator shafts
- If shaft found but person not at shaft column:
  - Person walks to shaft first
  - Then waits for elevator
- Maintains backward compatibility with fallback behavior

#### Fallback Mechanisms
- People without elevator requests use old 3-second simulated travel
- Ensures existing demos continue to work
- Allows gradual adoption of elevator system

### 4. Demo Application (`src/elevator_demo_app.cpp`)

Complete demonstration showing:
- Two elevator shafts at different locations (columns 5 and 10)
- Two elevator cars with different capacities
- Five facilities on different floors
- Four people using elevators to travel
- Visual representation with color-coded states:
  - **Idle**: Gray
  - **MovingUp**: Sky Blue
  - **MovingDown**: Purple
  - **DoorsOpen**: Green
  - **DoorsOpening/Closing**: Yellow
- Live status panel showing:
  - Elevator state, floor, occupancy
  - Stop queue for each elevator
  - Person state and location
- Automatic screenshot generation after 10 seconds

### 5. Rendering

#### Elevator Shaft Rendering
```cpp
// Vertical column with distinctive styling
DrawRectangle(x + 4, y + 4, width - 8, height - 8, Color{60, 60, 70, 255});
DrawRectangleLines(x + 4, y + 4, width - 8, height - 8, Color{100, 100, 120, 255});
```

#### Elevator Car Rendering
```cpp
// Color-coded by state
// Position based on smooth current_floor (float)
DrawRectangle(x + 6, y + 6, width - 12, height - 12, state_color);

// Occupancy indicator
DrawText(TextFormat("%d", car.current_occupancy), x + 18, y + 14, 16, BLACK);

// Door indicators when open/opening/closing
DrawRectangle(x + 8, y + 8, 4, height - 16, BLACK);  // Left door
DrawRectangle(x + width - 12, y + 8, 4, height - 16, BLACK);  // Right door
```

    0,   // start at ground floor
    8    // 8 passenger capacity
});

// Create person who will use elevator
auto person = ecs_world.CreateEntity("Alice");
Person alice("Alice", 0, 2.0f);
alice.SetDestination(5, 10.0f, "Going to work");
person.set<Person>(alice);
