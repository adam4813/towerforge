# TowerForge Achievement System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Achievement System has been successfully implemented in TowerForge, providing players with goals to work towards and recognition for their accomplishments. The system tracks both persistent and session-based achievements across multiple categories.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Components

- Tracks 19 achievements across 4 categories
- Manages achievement state (locked/unlocked)
- Serializes achievements to JSON for persistence
- Provides progress tracking for locked achievements
- Notifies game when achievements are unlocked

#### 2. AchievementsMenu (`include/ui/achievements_menu.h`, `src/ui/achievements_menu.cpp`)
- Displays all achievements in a scrollable menu
- Shows unlocked achievements with unlock dates

- Matches the ASCII mockup design from the issue

#### 3. Save/Load Integration
- Achievements persist across game sessions

```

- **Scrolling**: Use arrow keys or mouse wheel to scroll through achievements
- **Navigation**: ESC to close and return to menu/game
- **Progress Display**: Shows current progress for locked achievements
- **Unlock Dates**: Displays when achievements were unlocked
- **Visual Indicators**: Icons/emojis for each achievement type

#### Main Menu Integration
- Added "Achievements" option between "Load Game" and "Settings"
- Accessible from the title screen
- Achievements persist across game sessions

#### In-Game Notifications
- Achievement unlock notifications appear as SUCCESS notifications
- Displayed via the existing HUD notification system
- Shows "Achievement Unlocked: [Name]" message
- Appears in green color for 5 seconds

### Game Integration

#### Achievement Checking
Achievements are checked automatically during gameplay based on:
- **Population**: Current number of tenants in the tower
- **Income**: Total revenue earned (from TowerEconomy singleton)
- **Floors**: Number of floors in the tower grid
- **Satisfaction**: Average tenant satisfaction level

The game checks for achievements every frame when not paused, ensuring immediate feedback when milestones are reached.

#### Persistence
- Achievements are serialized to JSON format
- Stored with save files via SaveLoadManager
- Include unlock state and timestamp
- Preserved across save/load operations

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `include/core/achievement_manager.hpp` - Achievement manager header
- `src/core/achievement_manager.cpp` - Achievement manager implementation
- `include/ui/achievements_menu.h` - Achievements menu header
- `src/ui/achievements_menu.cpp` - Achievements menu implementation
- `achievements_menu.png` - Screenshot of achievements menu
- `main_menu_with_achievements.png` - Screenshot of main menu

### Modified Files
- `include/core/save_load_manager.hpp` - Added achievement manager support
- `src/core/save_load_manager.cpp` - Added achievement serialization/deserialization
- `include/ui/main_menu.h` - Added Achievements menu option
- `src/ui/main_menu.cpp` - Implemented achievements menu option
- `src/main.cpp` - Integrated achievement system into game loop
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Added new source files to build
- `src/core/CMakeLists.txt` - Added achievement_manager.cpp

## Architecture

The achievement system follows TowerForge's existing patterns:

### Separation of Concerns
- **Core**: Achievement logic and data (achievement_manager)
- **UI**: Achievement display and interaction (achievements_menu)
- **Integration**: Game loop hooks and notification system (main.cpp)

### Persistence Strategy
- Achievements are part of the game state
- SaveLoadManager handles serialization
- Achievement state is optional in save files (backward compatible)

### Notification Pattern
- Uses existing HUD notification system
- SUCCESS type for achievement unlocks
- No new UI components needed for notifications

## Usage

### Accessing Achievements Menu
1. Launch TowerForge
2. From the title screen, select "Achievements"
3. View unlocked and locked achievements
4. See progress on locked achievements
5. Press ESC to return to menu

### In-Game Achievement Tracking
- Achievements are checked automatically during gameplay
- When an achievement is unlocked, a notification appears
- Achievement progress updates in real-time
- Access the achievements menu from the pause menu (future enhancement)

### Testing Achievements
To manually unlock achievements for testing:
```cpp
achievement_manager.UnlockAchievement("pop_10");
achievement_manager.UnlockAchievement("income_10k");
```

## Technical Details

### Data Structures

#### Achievement
```cpp
struct Achievement {
    std::string id;                    // Unique identifier
    std::string name;                  // Display name
    std::string description;           // Description
    std::string icon;                  // Icon/emoji
    AchievementType type;              // Category
    int requirement;                   // Threshold to unlock
    bool unlocked;                     // Unlock status
    optional<time_point> unlock_time;  // When unlocked
};
```

#### AchievementManager Methods
- `Initialize()` - Set up default achievements
- `CheckAchievements(pop, income, floors, satisfaction)` - Check for unlocks
- `UnlockAchievement(id)` - Manually unlock
- `GetAllAchievements()` - Get all achievements
- `Serialize()/Deserialize()` - JSON persistence
- `PopNewlyUnlocked()` - Get and clear new unlocks

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "achievements": [
    {
      "id": "pop_10",
      "unlocked": true,
      "unlock_time": 1710512345
    },
    {
      "id": "income_10k",
      "unlocked": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future versions:
- Steam/platform integration for cloud achievements
- Achievement statistics and leaderboards
- More achievement categories (speed runs, efficiency, etc.)
- Secret/hidden achievements
- Achievement rewards (in-game bonuses)
- Achievement sound effects
- Animated achievement unlock effects
- Achievement screen in pause menu
- Share achievements on social media
