# Accessibility Features - Testing Guide

This document provides a comprehensive testing guide for the accessibility features implemented in TowerForge.

## Test Environment Setup

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cd /home/runner/work/towerforge/towerforge
   cmake --preset native
   cmake --build --preset native-debug
   ```

2. The executable is located at:
   ```
   build/native/bin/Debug/towerforge
   ```

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Access Accessibility Settings from Main Menu
**Steps:**
1. Launch TowerForge
2. Navigate to "Settings" using mouse or UP/DOWN keys
3. Press ENTER on "Settings"
4. Navigate to "Accessibility" using UP/DOWN keys
5. Press ENTER on "Accessibility"

**Expected Result:**
✓ Accessibility Settings menu appears with three options:
  - High-Contrast Mode (checkbox)
  - Font Scale (slider)
  - Keyboard Navigation (checkbox)

### Test 2: Test High-Contrast Mode Toggle
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "High-Contrast Mode" using UP/DOWN keys
2. Press SPACE to toggle

**Expected Result:**
✓ Checkbox toggles on/off
✓ Menu colors change immediately:
  - When enabled: Yellow/White colors instead of Gold/Gray
  - When disabled: Returns to Gold/Gray colors
✓ Borders become thicker (3px vs 2px) when enabled

### Test 3: Test Font Scaling
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "Font Scale" using UP/DOWN keys
2. Press LEFT arrow multiple times
3. Press RIGHT arrow multiple times
4. Observe text size changes

**Expected Result:**
✓ Slider moves left/right
✓ Percentage value updates (50% - 300%)
✓ All text in menu scales immediately
✓ Minimum value is 50%
✓ Maximum value is 300%

### Test 4: Test Keyboard Navigation
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "Keyboard Navigation" using UP/DOWN keys
2. Press SPACE to toggle

**Expected Result:**
✓ Checkbox toggles on/off
✓ Setting is saved
✓ Keyboard navigation continues to work (setting only affects future sessions)

### Test 5: Settings Persistence
**Steps:**
1. Set High-Contrast Mode to ON
2. Set Font Scale to 150%
3. Press ESC to return to main menu
4. Select "Settings" → "Accessibility" again

**Expected Result:**
✓ High-Contrast Mode is still ON
✓ Font Scale is still 150%
✓ Settings file `accessibility_settings.json` exists in game directory

### Test 6: Access from Pause Menu (In-Game)
**Steps:**
1. Start a new game from main menu
2. Press ESC to open pause menu
3. Navigate to "Settings"
4. Navigate to "Accessibility"
5. Modify settings

**Expected Result:**
✓ Same accessibility menu appears
✓ Settings changes apply immediately
✓ Can navigate back with ESC
✓ Game remains paused

### Test 7: Keyboard Navigation Throughout UI
**Steps:**
1. From main menu, use only keyboard to navigate:
   - UP/DOWN to select menu items
   - ENTER to activate
   - ESC to go back

**Expected Result:**
✓ Can navigate entire menu system with keyboard
✓ Current selection is visually highlighted
✓ Pulsing animation on selected item
✓ Arrow indicator (">") shows current position

### Test 8: Font Scaling Applied Globally
**Steps:**
1. Set Font Scale to 200%
2. Navigate through different menus:
   - Main menu
   - Settings menu
   - General Settings
   - Accessibility Settings

**Expected Result:**
✓ All text is scaled to 200% in all menus
✓ Text remains readable and properly positioned
✓ No text overflow or clipping

### Test 9: High-Contrast Focus Indicators
**Steps:**
1. Enable High-Contrast Mode
2. Use keyboard to navigate menu items
3. Observe focus indicators

**Expected Result:**
✓ Selected items have yellow/bright borders
✓ Borders are thicker (3px)
✓ Text contrast is high (black on yellow/white)
✓ Easy to see which item is selected

### Test 10: Mouse and Keyboard Interoperability
**Steps:**
1. Use keyboard to select an item
2. Move mouse to hover over a different item
3. Click with mouse
4. Use keyboard again

**Expected Result:**
✓ Keyboard selection updates when mouse hovers
✓ Mouse click activates item
✓ Can switch between mouse and keyboard seamlessly
✓ Focus follows user input method

## Automated Test Results

## Known Limitations

1. **Font Scaling Range**: Limited to 50%-300% to prevent extreme UI distortion
2. **Keyboard Navigation Toggle**: The toggle setting is available but keyboard navigation is always enabled (the setting is for future use)
3. **Settings File Location**: Saved in game root directory, may not be writable in some installations

## Accessibility Compliance
