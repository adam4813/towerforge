# Facility System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete facility system for TowerForge with four core facility types (Office, Residential, RetailShop, Lobby) as required by the issue, plus support for legacy facility types.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Components (`include/core/components.hpp`)
- **Updated BuildingComponent Type enum** with:
  - Office
  - Residential (new - for condominiums)
  - RetailShop (renamed from Shop)
  - Lobby
  - Restaurant (legacy)
  - Hotel (legacy)
  - Elevator (legacy)
- Added comprehensive documentation for each facility type
- Maintains existing component structure (type, floor, width, capacity, current_occupancy)

### 2. FacilityManager (`include/core/facility_manager.hpp`, `src/core/facility_manager.cpp`)
A new high-level API for facility management:

**Key Features**:
- `CreateFacility()`: Creates and places facilities on the grid with validation
- `RemoveFacility()`: Removes facilities by entity reference
- `RemoveFacilityAt()`: Removes facilities by grid position
- `GetDefaultWidth()`: Provides sensible default widths for each facility type
- `GetDefaultCapacity()`: Provides sensible default capacities for each facility type
- `GetTypeName()`: String representation of facility types
- `GetFacilityColor()`: Color codes for rendering
- `GetFacilityType()`: Get facility type from entity ID

**Default Attributes**:
| Facility | Width | Capacity | Purpose |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| Office | 8 | 20 | Commercial workspace |
| Residential | 6 | 4 | Family housing |
| RetailShop | 4 | 15 | Retail shopping |
| Lobby | 10 | 50 | Main entrance |
| Restaurant | 6 | 30 | Food service |
| Hotel | 10 | 40 | Temporary lodging |
| Elevator | 2 | 8 | Vertical transport |

### 3. ECS Integration (`include/core/ecs_world.hpp`, `src/core/ecs_world.cpp`)
- Integrated FacilityManager into ECSWorld
- Added `GetFacilityManager()` accessor method
- Updated building occupancy monitor system to use FacilityManager for type names

### 4. Documentation (`docs/FACILITIES.md`)
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Detailed description of each core facility type
- Gameplay roles and attributes
- Placement rules and requirements
- Technical implementation details
- Code examples for creating and removing facilities
- Visual design color scheme
- Future enhancement plans

### 5. Visual Rendering Updates
Updated rendering code to use facility types consistently:

**Color Scheme**:
- Office: SKYBLUE (professional, clean)
- Residential: PURPLE (warm, homey)
- RetailShop: GREEN (commercial, vibrant)
- Lobby: GOLD (prestigious, welcoming)
- Restaurant: RED (energetic, food-related)
- Hotel: DARKBLUE (luxurious, calm)
- Elevator: GRAY (utilitarian, neutral)

### 6. Testing (`src/test_facilities.cpp`)
Comprehensive test suite with 7 test cases:
1. ✅ Create facilities using FacilityManager
2. ✅ Verify grid placement
3. ✅ Verify facility attributes
4. ✅ Remove facility by entity
5. ✅ Remove facility by grid position
6. ✅ Attempt to create facility in occupied space (collision detection)
7. ✅ Create facility with custom width

All tests pass successfully!

### 7. Example Applications
- **main.cpp**: Updated to use FacilityManager for creating facilities
- **screenshot_app.cpp**: Updated to demonstrate all core facility types with proper colors

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Facilities can be placed and removed via the grid system**
- FacilityManager integrates with TowerGrid for placement validation
- RemoveFacility() and RemoveFacilityAt() provide flexible removal options
- Collision detection prevents invalid placements

✅ **Each type is visually distinct**
- Each facility type has a unique color
- Colors are semantically meaningful (e.g., Gold for Lobby, Purple for Residential)
- Rendering system uses BuildingComponent types consistently

✅ **Data structures and ECS components are extensible**
- BuildingComponent Type enum is easy to extend
- FacilityManager default attributes are centralized and easy to modify
- New facility types can be added by:
  1. Adding to Type enum
  2. Adding cases to GetDefaultWidth/Capacity/TypeName/Color methods
  3. Updating rendering switch statements

✅ **Documentation covers usage and intended gameplay roles**
- FACILITIES.md provides comprehensive documentation
- README.md includes Facility System section with examples
- Code is well-commented with usage examples
- Test file demonstrates all major use cases

## Files Changed
- `include/core/components.hpp` - Updated BuildingComponent
- `include/core/facility_manager.hpp` - New FacilityManager class
- `src/core/facility_manager.cpp` - FacilityManager implementation
- `include/core/ecs_world.hpp` - Added FacilityManager integration
- `src/core/ecs_world.cpp` - FacilityManager initialization
- `src/core/CMakeLists.txt` - Added facility_manager.cpp
- `src/main.cpp` - Updated to use FacilityManager
- `src/screenshot_app.cpp` - Updated rendering and facility creation
- `docs/FACILITIES.md` - New comprehensive documentation
- `docs/facility_demo_screenshot.png` - Visual demonstration
- `README.md` - Added Facility System section
- `src/test_facilities.cpp` - New comprehensive test suite
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Added test_facilities executable

## Technical Highlights

### Clean Separation of Concerns
- **Core**: Facility logic is in FacilityManager (no rendering dependencies)
- **Rendering**: Color mapping is separate from core logic
- **Grid**: TowerGrid remains generic (stores entity IDs, not facility-specific data)

### ECS-Friendly Design
- Facilities are entities with BuildingComponent and GridPosition components
- Systems can query facilities using standard ECS patterns
- FacilityManager provides high-level convenience without hiding ECS

### Minimal Changes
- Existing code structure preserved
- Legacy facility types maintained for compatibility
- Only added new functionality, didn't break existing systems

### Future-Ready
- Easy to add new facility types
- Supports custom facility attributes
- Extensible for economic systems, upgrades, etc.

## Usage Examples

### Create a Facility
```cpp
auto& facility_mgr = ecs_world.GetFacilityManager();
auto office = facility_mgr.CreateFacility(
    BuildingComponent::Type::Office,
    floor, column, width, "OfficeName"
);
```

### Remove a Facility
```cpp
facility_mgr.RemoveFacility(office);
// or
facility_mgr.RemoveFacilityAt(floor, column);
```

### Query Facilities
```cpp
ecs_world.GetWorld().each([](BuildingComponent& bc) {
    // Process each facility
    if (bc.type == BuildingComponent::Type::Office) {
        // Do something with offices
    }
});
```

## Conclusion
This implementation fully satisfies all requirements from the issue and provides a solid foundation for future facility-related features including economics, upgrades, and advanced gameplay mechanics.
