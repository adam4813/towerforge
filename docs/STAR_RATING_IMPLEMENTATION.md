# Star Rating & Tower Progression System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive star rating system that evaluates overall tower quality and provides progression milestones for players. The system displays in real-time and updates based on tower statistics collected from the ECS components.

## Features Implemented

### 1. TowerRating Component
- Added to `GameState` structure in `include/ui/hud.h`
- Tracks:
  - Current star rating (1-5)
  - Average tenant satisfaction
  - Total number of tenants
  - Total floor count
  - Hourly income
  - Next milestone requirements

### 2. Star Rating Calculation Logic
- Implemented in `src/main.cpp` as `CalculateTowerRating()`
- Collects statistics from ECS world:
  - Tenants from `FacilityEconomics` components
  - Satisfaction from `Satisfaction` components
  - Floor count from `TowerGrid`
  - Income rate from game state
- Updates every frame for real-time feedback

### 3. Visual Display
- Star rating overlay in top-right corner of HUD
- Shows:
  - Visual star display (★★★☆☆ format)
  - Current tower statistics
  - Next milestone requirements
  - Progress indicators

### 4. End-Game Summary
- Congratulations overlay when 5 stars achieved
- Shows final statistics
- Allows continued play after achievement

## Star Rating Thresholds

| Stars | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Starting level |
| ★★☆☆☆ | 25+ tenants |
| ★★★☆☆ | 50+ tenants AND 70%+ satisfaction |
| ★★★★☆ | 100+ tenants AND 75%+ satisfaction AND 20+ floors |
| ★★★★★ | 200+ tenants AND 80%+ satisfaction AND 40+ floors AND $10,000+/hr income |

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **include/ui/hud.h**
   - Added `TowerRating` struct
   - Extended `GameState` with rating field
   - Added rendering methods for star rating and end-game summary

2. **src/ui/hud.cpp**
   - Implemented `RenderStarRating()` - displays rating overlay
   - Implemented `RenderEndGameSummary()` - shows congratulations
   - Updated `Render()` to call new methods

3. **src/main.cpp**
   - Added `CalculateTowerRating()` function
   - Integrated rating calculation in game loop
   - Real-time statistics collection from ECS

4. **CMakeLists.txt**
   - Added `star_rating_demo` target for testing

### Files Added

1. **star_rating_demo.cpp**
   - Standalone demo application
   - Shows 3-star tower with realistic statistics
   - Generates screenshot for documentation

2. **star_rating_demo.png**
   - Visual demonstration of the system
   - Shows HUD with star rating overlay
   - Included in README.md
