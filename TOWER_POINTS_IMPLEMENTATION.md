# Implementation Summary: Tower Points & Research System Enhancement

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive **Tower Points** system that replaces the simple milestone-based research point system. Tower Points are generated by hiring management staff and building management facilities, creating a meta-progression system where players must invest in tower management infrastructure to unlock advanced features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core System Changes

#### ResearchNode Component (`include/core/components.hpp`)
**Added Features:**
- **Hidden State**: New `ResearchNodeState::Hidden` for nodes not yet visible
- **Conditional Prerequisites**:
  - `min_star_rating`: Requires minimum tower rating
  - `min_population`: Requires minimum population
  - `required_facilities`: Specific facilities that must exist
- **Methods**:
  - `CanUnlock()`: Checks all prerequisites including conditional ones
  - `IsVisible()`: Checks visibility prerequisites

#### ResearchTree Component (`include/core/components.hpp`)
**Replaced Research Points with Tower Points:**
- `tower_points`: Available points to spend (was `research_points`)
- `management_staff_count`: Tracks management staff
- `tower_points_per_hour`: Current generation rate
- `accumulated_points`: Fractional point accumulation

**New Methods:**
- `GenerateTowerPoints(delta_time)`: Generates points from staff
- `UpdateManagementStaffCount(count)`: Updates staff count

#### BuildingComponent (`include/core/components.hpp`)
**Added Management Facilities:**
- `ManagementOffice`: Main management facility (requires 5 staff)
- `SatelliteOffice`: Branch management (requires 3 staff)

**New Method:**
- `IsManagementFacility()`: Checks if facility generates tower points

### 2. System Implementation

#### Tower Points Generation System (`src/core/ecs_world.cpp`)
**Replaced milestone-based system with:**
- Runs every second
- Counts management staff in management facilities
- Generates points: `staff_count * 1 point/hour * time_elapsed`
- Accumulates fractional points for smooth progression

**Old System (Removed):**
- 5 points per 10 tenants
- 3 points per $1,000/hour income

**New System:**
- Continuous point generation from management staff
- Rate scales with number of staff hired
- Encourages strategic facility placement

### 3. Facility Manager Updates

#### `src/core/facility_manager.cpp`
Added support for new facility types:
- `ManagementOffice`: Width 8, Capacity 10, Color dark slate
- `SatelliteOffice`: Width 6, Capacity 6, Color lighter slate

### 4. UI Enhancements

#### Research Tree Menu (`src/ui/research_tree_menu.cpp`)
**Header Display:**
- Shows "Tower Points" instead of "Research Points"
- Displays generation rate: "Generation: X pts/hr"
- Shows management staff count

**Node Rendering:**
- Supports `Hidden` state with dark background
- Shows conditional prerequisites in details panel:
  - Minimum star rating
  - Minimum population
  - Required facilities

**Details Panel:**
- Enhanced to show unlock conditions separately
- Better organization of requirements

### 5. Lua Integration

#### Lua API (`src/core/lua_mod_manager.cpp`)
**New Function:** `TowerForge.RegisterResearchNode()`

Allows mods to register custom research nodes with:
- Basic properties (id, name, description, icon, type)
- Cost in tower points
- Grid position
- Effect values and targets
- Research prerequisites
- Conditional prerequisites (star rating, population, facilities)

**Example Usage:**
```lua
TowerForge.RegisterResearchNode({
    id = "hotel_unlock",
    name = "Luxury Lodging",
    type = "FacilityUnlock",
    cost = 30,
    grid_row = 1,
    grid_column = 3,
    effect_target = "Hotel",
    prerequisites = {"office_unlock"},
    min_star_rating = 2,
    min_population = 50
})
```

### 6. Default Research Tree

#### Updated Initial Tree (`include/core/components.hpp`)
**Row 0 (Basic):**
- Fast Elevators (10 pts)
- Office Spaces (5 pts)
- Retail Shops (5 pts)
- **NEW:** Tower Management (15 pts, requires 20 pop)

**Row 1 (Mid):**
- Express Elevators (20 pts, requires Fast Elevators)
- Large Elevators (15 pts, requires Fast Elevators)
- Revenue Optimization (15 pts, requires Office)
- **NEW:** Branch Management (25 pts, requires management + 2-star)
- **NEW:** Fine Dining (30 pts, requires shop + 2-star + 50 pop)

**Row 2 (Advanced):**
- Rapid Construction (25 pts, requires 3-star)
- Efficient Building (30 pts, requires management office)
- Quality Service (25 pts, requires Revenue Optimization)
- **NEW:** Gaming Entertainment/Arcade (35 pts, requires restaurant + 3-star + 100 pop)
- **NEW:** Wellness Center/Gym (40 pts, requires restaurant + 3-star + 75 pop)
