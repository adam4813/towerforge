## Documentation Reorganization

### Active Documents (Preserved)

**Essential Guides** (retained at root):
- README.md - Quick start and overview
- AGENTS.md - AI agent development workflow
- TESTING.md - Test infrastructure
- UI_DEVELOPMENT_BIBLE.md - UI patterns and Gang of Four designs

**System Documentation** (docs/):
- 40+ files covering individual systems
- All referenced by master documents
- Organized by topic (gameplay, UI, accessibility, technical)

**Navigation**:
- docs/DOCS_INDEX.md - Comprehensive navigation hub

### Archived Documents

**Created**: `docs/deprecated_archive/` directory

**Moved** (14 implementation summaries):
1. IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
2. FEATURE_SUMMARY.md
3. UI_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
4. NOTIFICATION_CENTER_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
5. TOOLTIP_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
6. ACCESSIBILITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md
7. GENERAL_SETTINGS_MENU_IMPLEMENTATION.md
8. PAUSE_MENU_IMPLEMENTATION.md
9. STAR_RATING_IMPLEMENTATION.md
10. TITLE_SCREEN_IMPLEMENTATION.md
11. TOWER_POINTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md
12. TUTORIAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md
13. mouse_event_system_implementation.md
14. IMPLEMENTATION.md

**Rationale**: These were point-in-time implementation notes superseded by comprehensive master documents.
